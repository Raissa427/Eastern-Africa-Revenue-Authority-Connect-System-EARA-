# Email Invitation Fix Guide

## Problem Description
The meeting invitation email sending functionality was not working properly. Users reported that the send button wasn't working and no errors were visible in the browser console.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Enhanced Error Logging
- Added detailed console logging in the backend to track email sending attempts
- Improved error handling in the frontend to show more detailed error messages
- Added comprehensive logging for both committee and subcommittee email sending

### 2. Email Test Endpoints
- Created new test endpoints to verify email configuration
- Added `/api/email-test/config` to test email configuration
- Added `/api/email-test/send-test` to send test emails
- Added `/api/email-test/test-invitation` to test meeting invitation emails specifically

### 3. Frontend Test Component
- Created `EmailTestComponent.jsx` for easy email testing
- Added route `/email-test` to access the test component
- Improved error handling and user feedback in invitation components

### 4. Debugging Tools
- Created PowerShell script `test-email-functionality.ps1` for comprehensive testing
- Enhanced console logging throughout the invitation process
- Added detailed response logging in frontend components

## How to Test and Fix

### Step 1: Test Email Configuration
1. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   cd EARACONNECT-BACKEND-master
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```

2. Run the test script:
   ```powershell
   ./test-email-functionality.ps1
   ```

3. Or test via the frontend:
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/email-test`
   - Click "Test Email Configuration"
   - Check the results

### Step 2: Verify Email Settings
Check `application.properties` for correct email configuration:
```properties
spring.mail.host=smtp.gmail.com
spring.mail.port=587
spring.mail.username=bernardmutabazi94@gmail.com
spring.mail.password=xqbvibnyjemsnuqs
```

**Important**: The Gmail app password might need to be regenerated if it's expired.

### Step 3: Test Email Sending
1. Use the test component at `http://localhost:3000/email-test`
2. Enter a valid email address
3. Try both "Send Test Email" and "Send Test Invitation"
4. Check if emails are received

### Step 4: Test Meeting Invitations
1. Create a meeting in the system
2. Navigate to the invitation manager
3. Select committees/subcommittees
4. Try sending invitations
5. Check browser console for detailed logs

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Gmail Authentication Failed
**Symptoms**: SMTP authentication errors in backend logs
**Solution**: 
- Generate a new Gmail app password
- Update `application.properties` with the new password
- Ensure 2-factor authentication is enabled on the Gmail account

### Issue 2: No Emails Being Sent
**Symptoms**: No error messages but emails not received
**Solution**:
- Check spam/junk folders
- Verify email addresses are correct
- Check backend logs for SMTP errors
- Test with the email test component

### Issue 3: Frontend Errors
**Symptoms**: Send button not working, console errors
**Solution**:
- Check browser console for detailed error messages
- Verify backend server is running on port 8081
- Check CORS configuration
- Test with the email test component

### Issue 4: No Recipients Found
**Symptoms**: "No recipients found" or similar messages
**Solution**:
- Ensure committees/subcommittees have members
- Check that members have valid email addresses
- Verify user accounts exist for committee members

## Debugging Steps

1. **Check Backend Logs**: Look for SMTP errors, authentication issues
2. **Test Email Configuration**: Use the test endpoints to verify setup
3. **Check Frontend Console**: Look for network errors, API failures
4. **Verify Data**: Ensure meetings, committees, and members exist
5. **Test Step by Step**: Use the test component to isolate issues
