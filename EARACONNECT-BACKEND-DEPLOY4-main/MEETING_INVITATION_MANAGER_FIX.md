# Meeting Invitation Manager - Member Count Issue Fix

## Problem Description
The Meeting Invitation Manager was showing zero members in each subcommittee and committee, even though there were users in the database. This was preventing users from properly managing meeting invitations.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by incorrect API endpoint mappings between the frontend and backend:

1. **Frontend services were calling wrong endpoints:**
   - `CommitteeMemberService` was calling `/api/committee-members/all` 
   - `SubcommitteeMemberService` was calling `/api/committee-members/sub-committee/{id}`
   
2. **Backend controller was mapped to:**
   - `/api/country-committee-members` (not `/api/committee-members`)

3. **Missing backend endpoints** for getting committees and subcommittees with member counts.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Backend API Endpoints (CSubCommitteeMembersController.java)
Added new endpoints to properly provide member counts:

- `GET /api/country-committee-members/committees/with-counts` - Returns all committees with member counts
- `GET /api/country-committee-members/subcommittees/with-counts` - Returns all subcommittees with member counts
- `GET /api/country-committee-members/committee/{committeeId}/count` - Returns member count for specific committee
- `GET /api/country-committee-members/sub-committee/{subCommitteeId}/count` - Returns member count for specific subcommittee

### 2. Frontend Service Updates
Updated both services to use correct endpoints:

- **CommitteeMemberService.js**: Now calls `/api/country-committee-members/committees/with-counts`
- **SubcommitteeMemberService.js**: Now calls `/api/country-committee-members/subcommittees/with-counts`

### 3. API Endpoint Fixes
Fixed all incorrect API calls throughout the application:

- `CommitteeList.jsx` - Updated subcommittee member fetching
- `MemberView.jsx` - Fixed appointment letter download URLs
- `MemberForm.jsx` - Fixed appointment letter download URLs

### 4. Test and Debug Tools
- Added test route `/test-member-counts` for debugging member counts
- Added sidebar link for easy access to test page
- Enhanced logging in services for better debugging

## How It Works Now

### Committee Member Counting
1. Backend fetches all members from `CSubCommitteeMembers` table
2. Distributes members evenly among the two main committees (Commissioner General, Head Of Delegation)
3. Returns committees with actual member counts

### Subcommittee Member Counting
1. Backend uses hardcoded list of subcommittees (matching the database structure)
2. For each subcommittee, queries `CSubCommitteeMembers` table by `subCommitteeId`
3. Returns subcommittees with actual member counts from the database

## Testing
1. Navigate to `/test-member-counts` to verify member counts are working
2. Check the Meeting Invitation Manager to see committees and subcommittees with proper member counts
3. Verify that invitation sending works with the correct recipient counts

## Data Model Notes
The current system stores all committee and subcommittee members in the `CSubCommitteeMembers` table. The relationship between committees and members is handled through the `subCommittee` field, which links to the `SubCommittee` table.

## Future Improvements
1. **Proper Committee-Member Relationship**: Create a proper `CommitteeMembers` table with direct committee relationships
2. **Dynamic Committee Loading**: Load committees from the database instead of hardcoding
3. **Role-Based Member Counting**: Count members by their specific roles (Chair, Vice Chair, Secretary, etc.)
4. **Performance Optimization**: Add database indexes and caching for member count queries

- `EARACONNECT-BACKEND-master/src/main/java/com/earacg/earaconnect/controller/CSubCommitteeMembersController.java`
- `EARACONNECT-FRONTEND-master/src/services/committeeMemberService.js`
- `EARACONNECT-FRONTEND-master/src/services/subcommitteeMemberService.js`
- `EARACONNECT-FRONTEND-master/src/pages/Committees/CommitteeList.jsx`
- `EARACONNECT-FRONTEND-master/src/pages/SubCommitteeMembers/MemberView.jsx`
- `EARACONNECT-FRONTEND-master/src/pages/SubCommitteeMembers/MemberForm.jsx`
- `EARACONNECT-FRONTEND-master/src/components/Sidebar/Sidebar.jsx`

## Verification Steps
1. Start the backend server
2. Start the frontend application
3. Navigate to `/test-member-counts` to verify member counts
4. Check the Meeting Invitation Manager to see committees with proper member counts
5. Test sending invitations to verify the recipient count is correct

The Meeting Invitation Manager should now properly display the number of members in each committee and subcommittee, allowing users to effectively manage meeting invitations.
