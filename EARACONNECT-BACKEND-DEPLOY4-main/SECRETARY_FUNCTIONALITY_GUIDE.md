# Secretary Functionality Guide - Committee Management System

## Overview
This guide covers the complete Secretary functionality implementation, focusing on location-based restrictions, meeting management, resolution assignment with percentage validation, and comprehensive role-based access control.

## 🔐 Secretary Role & Location Restrictions

### Secretary Role Types
The system supports three secretary role types:
- `SECRETARY` - General Secretary
- `COMMITTEE_SECRETARY` - Committee-specific Secretary  
- `DELEGATION_SECRETARY` - Delegation Secretary

### Location-Based Access Control
**Core Principle**: Secretaries can only manage meetings hosted in their assigned country.

**Implementation**:
- Secretaries must have a `country_id` assigned in their profile
- Meeting management is restricted to meetings where `meeting.hostingCountry.id == secretary.country.id`
- All secretary operations validate location before execution

### Validation Service
**File**: `SecretaryValidationService.java`

**Key Methods**:
```java
// Validate secretary can manage meeting
boolean validateSecretaryLocation(User secretary, Meeting meeting)

// Check if user has secretary role
boolean isSecretary(User user)

// Validate meeting creation permissions
boolean validateSecretaryCanCreateMeeting(Long secretaryId, Long hostingCountryId)

// Validate minute-taking permissions
ValidationResult validateMinuteTaking(Long secretaryId, Long meetingId)
```

## 🏢 Secretary Dashboard

### Dashboard Features
**File**: `SecretaryDashboard.jsx`

**Core Components**:
1. **Location Validation Display**: Shows country assignment status
2. **Meeting Statistics**: Total, upcoming, and completed meetings
3. **Quick Actions**: Create meetings, manage resolutions
4. **Recent Meetings**: Location-filtered meeting list
5. **Pending Resolutions**: Resolutions awaiting assignment

**Location Validation Messages**:
- ✅ **Success**: "Location validated: [Country]. You can manage meetings in this country."
- ❌ **Error**: "No country assigned. Please contact admin to assign your country."

### Access Control
- Dashboard only loads meetings from secretary's assigned country
- Create meeting button disabled if no country assigned
- Real-time validation of secretary permissions

## 📅 Meeting Management

### Meeting Creation with Location Validation
**Enhanced MeetingService**:
```java
public Meeting createMeeting(Meeting meeting) {
    // Validate secretary location if creator is a secretary
    if (secretaryValidationService.isSecretary(meeting.getCreatedBy())) {
        boolean locationValid = secretaryValidationService.validateSecretaryLocation(
            meeting.getCreatedBy(), meeting);
        
        if (!locationValid) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Location validation failed");
        }
    }
    // ... continue with meeting creation
}
```

### Meeting Minutes Management
**Component**: `MeetingMinutesEditor.jsx`

**Features**:
- ✅ **Location validation**: Checks secretary can edit minutes for meeting
- ✅ **Template system**: Provides structured minutes template
- ✅ **Auto-save validation**: Validates permissions before saving
- ✅ **Word count**: Real-time word counting
- ✅ **Status updates**: Marks meeting as completed when minutes saved

**Template Structure**:
```
MEETING MINUTES

Meeting: [Title]
Date: [Date and Time]
Location: [Location]
Hosting Country: [Country]

ATTENDEES:
[List attendees here]

AGENDA ITEMS:
[Numbered agenda items]

DISCUSSIONS:
[Key discussions and decisions]

ACTION ITEMS:
[Action items with responsible parties]

RESOLUTIONS:
[Resolutions passed during meeting]
```

### Meeting Invitations
**Integration**: Existing invitation system with secretary validation
- Secretaries can send invitations for meetings in their country
- Email and in-system notifications automatically sent
- Role-based invitation targeting (by meeting type)

## 📋 Resolution Assignment System

### Percentage-Based Assignment
**Component**: `ResolutionAssignmentForm.jsx`

**Core Features**:
- ✅ **100% Validation**: Total percentages must equal exactly 100%
- ✅ **Duplicate Prevention**: Cannot assign same subcommittee twice
- ✅ **Real-time Validation**: Live percentage calculation and error display
- ✅ **Visual Indicators**: Color-coded validation status
- ✅ **Assignment Summary**: Clear breakdown of assignments

**Validation Rules**:
```javascript
// Total percentage must equal 100%
const total = assignments.reduce((sum, assignment) => 
  sum + parseInt(assignment.contributionPercentage || 0), 0);

if (total !== 100) {
  errors.push(`Total contribution must equal 100%. Current total: ${total}%`);
}

// Individual percentages between 1-100
if (percentage <= 0 || percentage > 100) {
  errors.push(`Contribution percentage must be between 1 and 100`);
}
```

### Backend Validation
**Enhanced ResolutionService**:
```java
public void assignResolutionToSubcommittees(Long resolutionId, 
    List<Map<String, Object>> assignments, Long assignedById) {
    
    // Validate secretary can assign resolutions
    ValidationResult validation = 
        secretaryValidationService.validateResolutionAssignment(assignedById);
    
    if (!validation.isValid()) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Cannot assign resolution: " + validation.getMessage());
    }
    
    // Validate total percentage equals 100
    int totalPercentage = assignments.stream()
        .mapToInt(assignment -> (Integer) assignment.get("contributionPercentage"))
        .sum();
    
    if (totalPercentage != 100) {
        throw new RuntimeException("Total contribution percentage must equal 100%");
    }
}
```

## 🔄 API Endpoints

## 📊 Attendance Management

### Placeholder Implementation
**Current Status**: Placeholder system implemented in existing `MeetingService`

**Features Available**:
- Basic attendance recording structure
- `AttendanceRecord` class for data transfer
- Database schema supports attendance tracking

**Future Enhancement Areas**:
1. **QR Code Check-in**: Generate meeting-specific QR codes
2. **Geolocation Verification**: Verify attendee is at meeting location  
3. **Real-time Tracking**: Live attendance updates during meetings
4. **Integration with Minutes**: Link attendance to meeting minutes

**Current Placeholder Structure**:
```java
public static class AttendanceRecord {
    private Long userId;
    private String status; // PRESENT, ABSENT, LATE
    private String notes;
}
```

## 👤 Profile Management

### Secretary Profile Updates
**Integration**: Uses existing user profile system with secretary-specific validation

**Updatable Fields**:
- Personal information (name, phone, address)
- Department and position
- **Country assignment**: Critical for location-based access (Admin-only)

**Restrictions**:
- Role cannot be changed (Admin-only)
- Country assignment requires Admin approval
- Email changes require additional verification

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

### Secretary Dashboard Testing
**Location Validation Tests**:
```javascript
// Test 1: Secretary with country assigned
expect(locationValidation.valid).toBe(true);
expect(locationValidation.message).toContain("Location validated");

// Test 2: Secretary without country
expect(locationValidation.valid).toBe(false);
expect(locationValidation.message).toContain("No country assigned");
```

### Resolution Assignment Tests
**Percentage Validation Tests**:
```javascript
// Test 1: Valid 100% assignment
const assignments = [
  { subcommitteeId: 1, contributionPercentage: 70 },
  { subcommitteeId: 2, contributionPercentage: 30 }
];
expect(validateAssignments(assignments)).toHaveLength(0);

// Test 2: Invalid total percentage
const invalidAssignments = [
  { subcommitteeId: 1, contributionPercentage: 60 },
  { subcommitteeId: 2, contributionPercentage: 30 }
];
expect(validateAssignments(invalidAssignments)).toContain("Total contribution must equal 100%");
```

### Meeting Access Tests
**Location-Based Access Tests**:
```java
// Test 1: Secretary from same country as meeting
assertTrue(secretaryValidationService.validateSecretaryLocation(secretary, meeting));

// Test 2: Secretary from different country
assertFalse(secretaryValidationService.validateSecretaryLocation(secretary, meeting));
```
