# EARAPerformanceDashboard Implementation

## Overview

The EARAPerformanceDashboard is a comprehensive performance analytics dashboard designed for EARACONNECT committee members, subcommittees, and secretaries. It provides real-time insights into performance metrics, task completion rates, resolution statuses, and comparative analysis across countries.

## Features

### üéØ **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**
- **Approval Rate**: Percentage of approved resolutions
- **Task Completion**: Percentage of completed tasks
- **Average Resolution Time**: Average time to resolve issues (in days)
- **Member Participation**: Percentage of active member participation

### üìä **Data Visualization**
- **Gantt Charts**: Project timeline visualization with progress tracking
- **Progress Bars**: Visual representation of completion rates
- **Pie Charts**: Resolution status distribution
- **Bar Charts**: Country performance comparison
- **Area Charts**: Monthly performance trends
- **Line Charts**: Task completion trends

### üåç **Country Comparison**
- Performance metrics comparison across all member countries
- Filterable by country, committee, and time period
- Visual performance scoring system

### üìà **Real-time Analytics**
- Live data from database tables (reports, assigned resolutions)
- Filterable by time periods (week, month, quarter, year)
- Export functionality for data analysis

## Database Integration

### Tables Used
- **Reports Table**: Source for performance metrics and trends
- **Assigned Resolutions Table**: Source for task assignments and resolution statuses

### API Endpoints
The dashboard integrates with the following backend endpoints:

```
GET /api/dashboard/performance-metrics
GET /api/dashboard/country-performance
GET /api/dashboard/resolution-status
GET /api/dashboard/monthly-trends
GET /api/dashboard/task-assignments

GET /api/dashboard/committees
POST /api/dashboard/export
```

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- React 16.8+ (for hooks)
- recharts library for charts
- react-icons for icons

### Dependencies
```json
{
  "recharts": "^2.8.0",
  "react-icons": "^4.0.0"
}
```

### Installation
```bash
npm install recharts react-icons
```

## Usage

### Basic Implementation
```jsx
import EARAPerformanceDashboard from './components/Dashboard/EARAPerformanceDashboard';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <EARAPerformanceDashboard />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### With Page Wrapper
```jsx
import EARAPerformanceDashboardPage from './pages/EARAPerformanceDashboard/EARAPerformanceDashboardPage';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <EARAPerformanceDashboardPage />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Data Structure

### Performance Metrics
```javascript
{
  approvalRate: 85,        // Percentage
  taskCompletion: 72,      // Percentage
  averageResolutionTime: 15, // Days
  memberParticipation: 88   // Percentage
}
```

### Country Performance
```javascript
[
  {
    country: 'Kenya',
    approvalRate: 90,
    taskCompletion: 85,
    resolutionTime: 12,
    participation: 92
  }
  // ... more countries
]
```

### Resolution Status
```javascript
[
  {
    status: 'Approved',
    count: 156,
    percentage: 65
  }
  // ... more statuses
]
```

## Customization

### Styling
- CSS files are located in the same directories as their components
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Customizable color schemes and themes

### Data Sources
- Modify `EARADashboardService.js` to integrate with different APIs
- Update data transformation logic in the service
- Add new chart types by extending the component

### Filters
- Add new filter options in the filter section
- Modify the filter logic in the component
- Update the API calls to include new parameters

## Performance Considerations

### Data Loading
- Lazy loading of chart components
- Debounced filter changes
- Efficient re-rendering with React.memo

### API Optimization
- Parallel API calls for different data types
- Caching of frequently accessed data
- Error boundaries for graceful degradation

## Browser Support

- Modern browsers (Chrome 80+, Firefox 75+, Safari 13+)
- Mobile responsive design
- Progressive enhancement for older browsers

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Charts Not Rendering**
   - Check if recharts library is installed
   - Verify data structure matches expected format
   - Check browser console for errors

2. **API Integration Issues**
   - Verify API endpoints are accessible
   - Check network requests in browser dev tools
   - Ensure CORS is properly configured

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Check for unnecessary re-renders
   - Verify data size and optimize if needed
   - Use React DevTools Profiler for analysis

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by setting:
```javascript
localStorage.setItem('eara-dashboard-debug', 'true');
```
